            <div class="panel">
              <p>Whenever you purchase (eg book tickets) or make an online payment,
                 it needs to be securely processed and verified by a third party payment processor.  .</p>
                  <p> 1. These processors include Banks (for netbanking, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS transactions), 
                    Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Rupay etc (for credit and debit card transactions), 
                     Paytm, UPI apps and other payment wallets who charge a small fee for this 
                    service (â€˜payment gateway chargesâ€™).  These charges on crowdfunding websites 
                    are unavoidable.  </p>
                    <br>
              <p>
                 2. This is NOT Milaap fees. These fees go directly to the payment processor and 
                help us keep Milaap a safe place to donate.Payment gateways charge their fees
                 as a % of donation amount made. It varies based on the mode of payment and 
                 service provider.

                <p>
                  Yes, Milaap charges NO platform fees for individuals, NGOs and organizations alike. In fact,
                   organizations with 80G tax-exempt status also have the option to either issue tax-exemption
                    receipts from Milaap's dashboard or issue it separately. Receipts to donors from
                   Milaap's dashboard can be issued, at a click of a button. This feature is FREE
                    to use and entails NO FEES.</p>

            <h2 class="accordion">Does Milaap help in outreach of campaigns?</h2>
            <div class="panel"> 
              <p> 
                Over 98% of Milaapâ€™s fundraisers which have raised money do it for FREE using
                 our best-in-class social fundraising 
                technology and round-the-clock assistance and support from our relationship managers.
              </p> <br>
              <p>
                In certain scenarios, where the beneficiaries come from a disadvantaged backgrounds with 
                no digital literacy, exhausted most of their finances with no other sources available
                 and require funds very urgently; Milaap may consider them on a case-by-case basis for
                  outreach on social media and digital promotion platforms after verification and a signed
                   request letter from the beneficiary. This is subject to availability of our team members,
                 and situations where we believe promotions can achieve something significant for the cause.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                Similar to payment gateway costs where it's paid to payment processor, outreach costs are
                 paid towards social media and digital promotion platforms. To ensure that donor money
                  goes primarily to the intended purpose, we cap the outreach costs to not more than 15% 
                  of funds raised. Please note that Milaap doesn't 
                earn / keep any additional fee or commission for itself from the costs incurred through promotions.
